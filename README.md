## Example: Fetching GitHub Repository Size
The `gsp` function fetches and calculates the size of a GitHub repository:
```bash
function gsp() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: gsp <owner/repo>"
        return 1
    fi

    local repo=$1

    if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
        echo "Error: GITHUB_TOKEN is not set. Please check your .env file."
        return 1
    fi

    response=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/$repo)

    if echo "$response" | grep -q '"message": "Not Found"'; then
        echo "Repository not found or you don't have access."
        return 1
    fi

    size_kb=$(echo "$response" | grep '"size":' | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d ',')
    size_mb=$(echo "scale=2; $size_kb / 1024" | bc)
    size_gb=$(echo "scale=2; $size_mb / 1024" | bc)

    echo "Repository Size for $repo:"
    echo "- $size_kb KB"
    echo "- $size_mb MB"
    echo "- $size_gb GB"
}
```
