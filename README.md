## üìÇ Contents

### Files

  A template file to manage sensitive environment variables such as tokens and API keys. To use it:
  1. Copy the file and rename it to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
  2. Edit the `.env` file to add your variables (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

- **dotzshrc.txt**:  
  Contains sample `.zshrc` configurations with useful aliases, functions, and support for environment variables. You can use it as a reference or directly copy parts of it to your own `.zshrc`.

- **README.md**:  
  This documentation file provides details about the repository's purpose, usage, and structure.

## üåü Features

### üõ† Environment Variable Support
Manage sensitive tokens and API keys securely using an `.env` file, sourced in your shell configuration.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Custom Functions
Includes useful shell functions like:
- **Fetching GitHub repository sizes**:
  ```bash
  function get_repo_size() {
      if [ -z "$1" ]; then
          echo "Usage: get_repo_size <owner/repo>"
          return 1
      fi

      local repo=$1

      if [ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ]; then
          echo "Error: GITHUB_TOKEN is not set. Please check your .env file."
          return 1
      fi

      response=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/$repo)

      if echo "$response" | grep -q '"message": "Not Found"'; then
          echo "Repository not found or you don't have access."
          return 1
      fi

      size_kb=$(echo "$response" | grep '"size":' | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d ',')
      size_mb=$(echo "scale=2; $size_kb / 1024" | bc)
      size_gb=$(echo "scale=2; $size_mb / 1024" | bc)

      echo "Repository Size for $repo:"
      echo "- $size_kb KB"
      echo "- $size_mb MB"
      echo "- $size_gb GB"
  }
  ```

### üîó Aliases
